# Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to classify cybersecurity incidents and predict their triage grades using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist Security Operation Centers (SOCs) in managing and prioritizing incidents effectively.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and encoded features.
2. **Data Balancing**: Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance.
3. **Model Training**: Trained various models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models based on accuracy and F1 scores.

## Findings
- Random Forest performed the best among the models.
- Further improvements can be made through hyperparameter tuning.
